From The Shotbow Annihilation Wiki:

Annihilation is a team-based PvP gamemode with 4 teams, Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green. Your team's objective is to destroy the other 3 team's nexuses, while protecting your own. Each team has their own quarter of the map where they can gather resources, build defenses etc. Every player is in adventure mode, meaning block breaking is only possible with the correct tools. Your team wins when it is the last one with a nexus.

The game is split up into 5 phases, each phase lasting 10 minutes.

Phase 1: Nexus blocks are invincible
Phase 2: Nexus blocks lose their invincibility
Phase 3: Iron Golem boss mobs spawn and diamond ores spawn in the center of the map
Phase 4: No changes occur
Phase 5: Double Nexus damage

The game will stop at phase 5 and stay there until the game is over.

The Nexus is the most important block in the game. Each Nexus has only 75 hit points, and when mined it will lose 1 HP each time, 2 In Phase 5. There is no method to regain lost HP, so every hit matters. When mined it makes a very loud anvil sound at the base, or a light note block sound if you aren't close enough, to alert the team their nexus is being hit.

Once a team's Nexus is destroyed, that team will no longer re-spawn. The remaining members of the team will remain in the game until they die, meaning they can still attack and destroy your nexus.

In order to win, your team must be the last one with a nexus.

In addition to the above, there are several kinds of shops in which players can buy items with gold ingots. Currently there are 2 kinds of shops: Brewing and Weapon. Shops take the form of a sign.
